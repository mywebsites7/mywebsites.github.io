This is an Arduino project that creates a "Knight Rider" effect, also known as Larson Scanner. The Arduino Knight Rider is a circuit that features a series of LEDs that move back and forth in a "scanning" motion, creating a dynamic and eye-catching effect. The name Larson scanner is derived from Glen A. Larson, the creator of the original "Knight Rider" television show, which featured a car with a similar light sequence.
