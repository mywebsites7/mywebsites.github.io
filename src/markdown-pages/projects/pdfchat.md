This generative AI tool is designed to provide users with an interactive research assistance experience. It allows users to upload multiple PDF documents, which are then processed and transformed into text data. The text data is then analyzed using advanced natural language processing techniques to create embeddings (contextual representations) of the content. Large Language Models is the building block of this tool. The tool integrates several technologies, including PDF parsing, text splitting, embedding generation, and a question-answering system. It aims to assist researchers and individuals in quickly accessing and extracting relevant information from a collection of research documents in a conversational manner as you do with ChatGPT but with your own data.

## Key Features

- Multi-PDF Upload: Users can upload multiple PDF documents at once.
- Conversational Interface: Users can interact with the tool using natural language queries.
- Question-Answering: The tool retrieves relevant information from documents to answer user queries.
- Continuous Interaction: Users can ask multiple questions in a single session.
- Free and Paid version: the free version is built on an open source language model(Falcon 7B parameters) and the paid version is built on ChatGPT model, Please note that you pay openAI for your usage of their model but the tool is completely free from my part.
- User-friendly conversational interface
